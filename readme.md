# html2reflex

This little tool serves the purpose of translating HTML with TailwindCSS references
to Reflex-FRP function calls, so one can copy and paste TailwindCSS components
into Reflex-FRP programs quickly.

## Known problems

- [ ] Indentation for first child node is incorrect somehow.
      Haskell formatters are not offended, though.
- [ ] Input tags, and perhaps some others, still need implementation.
